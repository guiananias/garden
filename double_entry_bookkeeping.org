* Notes
** Why =Income= is representated as a negative value?
Because in general, they assume that =Income= is a negative value to assimilate
with withdrawing from an account A to an account B. So, the withdraw from A to B
is considered negative and can be categorized as Income.

So, the credit is everything that increases your balance and debit is everything
that decreases it, =Income= is the decrease from an account A that is doing the
transaction, thus decreasing their balance, and going to the B account, for example,
and increasing the credit and consequently your balance.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Based on that explanation, hereâ€™s another way to look at your balance report: every
negative figure means that that account or person or place has less money now than when
you started your ledger; and every positive figure means that that account or person or
place has more money now than when you started your ledger. Make sense?
